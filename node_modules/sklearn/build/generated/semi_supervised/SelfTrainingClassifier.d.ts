/**
  Self-training classifier.

  This [metaestimator](../../glossary.html#term-metaestimator) allows a given supervised classifier to function as a semi-supervised classifier, allowing it to learn from unlabeled data. It does this by iteratively predicting pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and adding them to the training set.

  The classifier will continue iterating until either max\_iter is reached, or no pseudo-labels were added to the training set in the previous iteration.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../semi_supervised.html#self-training).
