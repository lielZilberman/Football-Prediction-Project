/**
  Exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator.

  Important members are fit, predict.

  GridSearchCV implements a “fit” and a “score” method. It also implements “score\_samples”, “predict”, “predict\_proba”, “decision\_function”, “transform” and “inverse\_transform” if they are implemented in the estimator used.

  The parameters of the estimator used to apply these methods are optimized by cross-validated grid-search over a parameter grid.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../grid_search.html#grid-search).
