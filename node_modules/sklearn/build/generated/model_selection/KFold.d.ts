/**
  K-Folds cross-validator

  Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets. Split dataset into k consecutive folds (without shuffling by default).

  Each fold is then used once as a validation while the k - 1 remaining folds form the training set.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../cross_validation.html#k-fold).
