/**
  Stratified ShuffleSplit cross-validator

  Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets.

  This cross-validation object is a merge of StratifiedKFold and ShuffleSplit, which returns stratified randomized folds. The folds are made by preserving the percentage of samples for each class.

  Note: like the ShuffleSplit strategy, stratified random splits do not guarantee that all folds will be different, although this is still very likely for sizeable datasets.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../cross_validation.html#stratified-shuffle-split).
