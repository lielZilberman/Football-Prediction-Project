/**
  Leave One Group Out cross-validator

  Provides train/test indices to split data such that each training set is comprised of all samples except ones belonging to one specific group. Arbitrary domain specific group information is provided an array integers that encodes the group of each sample.

  For instance the groups could be the year of collection of the samples and thus allow for cross-validation against time-based splits.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../cross_validation.html#leave-one-group-out).
