  Randomized search on hyper parameters.

  The search strategy starts evaluating all the candidates with a small amount of resources and iteratively selects the best candidates, using more and more resources.

  The candidates are sampled at random from the parameter space and the number of sampled candidates is determined by `n\_candidates`.
