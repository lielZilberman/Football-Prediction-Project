  Convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token occurrences.

  It turns a collection of text documents into a scipy.sparse matrix holding token occurrence counts (or binary occurrence information), possibly normalized as token frequencies if norm=’l1’ or projected on the euclidean unit sphere if norm=’l2’.

  This text vectorizer implementation uses the hashing trick to find the token string name to feature integer index mapping.

  This strategy has several advantages:
