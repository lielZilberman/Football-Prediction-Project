/**
  Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD): robust estimator of covariance.

  The Minimum Covariance Determinant covariance estimator is to be applied on Gaussian-distributed data, but could still be relevant on data drawn from a unimodal, symmetric distribution. It is not meant to be used with multi-modal data (the algorithm used to fit a MinCovDet object is likely to fail in such a case). One should consider projection pursuit methods to deal with multi-modal datasets.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../covariance.html#robust-covariance).
