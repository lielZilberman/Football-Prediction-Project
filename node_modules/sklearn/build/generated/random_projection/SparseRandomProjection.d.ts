  Reduce dimensionality through sparse random projection.

  Sparse random matrix is an alternative to dense random projection matrix that guarantees similar embedding quality while being much more memory efficient and allowing faster computation of the projected data.

  If we note `s \= 1 / density` the components of the random matrix are drawn from:
