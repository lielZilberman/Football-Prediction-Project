  A random forest classifier.

  A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is controlled with the `max\_samples` parameter if `bootstrap=True` (default), otherwise the whole dataset is used to build each tree.
