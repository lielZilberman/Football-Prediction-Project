/**
  Gradient Boosting for classification.

  This algorithm builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise fashion; it allows for the optimization of arbitrary differentiable loss functions. In each stage `n\_classes\_` regression trees are fit on the negative gradient of the loss function, e.g. binary or multiclass log loss. Binary classification is a special case where only a single regression tree is induced.

  [`sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier`](sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier "sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier") is a much faster variant of this algorithm for intermediate datasets (`n\_samples >= 10\_000`).

  Read more in the [User Guide](../ensemble.html#gradient-boosting).
