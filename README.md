## Data & Features

Our football prediction project draws its strength from an expansive dataset encompassing five premier leagues:

- ![ Italian Serie A](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenrskelton/flag-icon/master/png/16/country-4x3/it.png " Italian Serie A")  Italian Serie A

The dataset spans an impressive timeline from the 2009-2010 season to the current 2022-2023 season, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of 
trends and patterns over the years. Organized meticulously, each season's data is stored within a dedicated CSV file.

Within this treasure trove of information, our focus is on a curated selection of features that have been demonstrated to be highly relevant in
 predicting match outcomes. These features are:

- **Team:** Identifying the participating teams in a match, a fundamental piece of information.
- **HGS (Home Goal Scored):** The average number of goals scored by the home team in their past matches.
- **AGS (Away Goal Scored):** The average number of goals scored by the away team in their recent games.
- **HAS (Home Attack Strength):** Reflects the offensive prowess of the home team, factoring in factors like player form and strategy.
- **AAS (Away Attack Strength):** Similar to HAS but for the away team, indicating their attacking capabilities.
- **HGC (Home Goal Conceded):** The average number of goals conceded by the home team in previous matches.
- **AGC (Away Goal Conceded):** The average number of goals conceded by the away team in recent games.
- **HDS (Home Defense Strength):** Assesses the defensive resilience of the home team, considering factors such as defensive tactics and player performance.
- **ADS (Away Defense Strength):** Analogous to HDS but focusing on the away team's defensive capabilities.

These meticulously chosen features collectively represent the core dynamics of a football match, covering attacking and defensive strengths and
 tendencies for both home and away teams. By meticulously processing and analyzing these factors, our prediction model gains a deep understanding 
of each team's strengths and weaknesses, allowing for accurate forecasts of match outcomes.

As our platform thrives on data-driven precision, each point in these features contributes significantly to our predictive algorithms.
 Our approach reflects a commitment to professionalism, data accuracy, and a passion for the sport that drives us to provide unparalleled 
predictions for soccer enthusiasts.
